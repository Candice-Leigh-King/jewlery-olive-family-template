      <p>As a white South African born just one year before the end of the
      oppressive apartheid regime, Candice has witnessed firsthand the enduring
      impact of systematic oppression on those around her. Living amongst
      individuals who have been its victims, she has seen the devastating legacy
      it leaves for generations to come. As the granddaughter of a World War Two
      survivor, it's in her blood to advocate for peace.</p>
